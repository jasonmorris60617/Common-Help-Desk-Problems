# Common-Help-Desk-Problems

These are some of the most common issues that a help desk technician should be prepared to solve to provide effective IT support:

Password resets are a frequent request, often requiring quick action to restore user access. 

Managing Active Directory (AD) is another critical skill, including creating or terminating user accounts, granting permissions to access specific Windows folders by adding users to AD groups, and handling Office 365 tasks such as adding or removing users from groups or email lists. 

Technicians often assist with hardware-related tasks like troubleshooting printing issues and resolving internet connectivity problems. 

Outlook-related issues are also common, ranging from syncing errors to profile setup. 

Helping users adapt to new operating systems during computer upgrades is another essential skill, as is addressing basic antivirus alerts, removing malicious software, and managing failed backup alerts. 

Additionally, technicians frequently install or update software for new employees, especially when users lack local admin permissions. Finally, troubleshooting application error messages is a vital part of resolving user issues and ensuring productivity. Mastering these tasks equips a help desk technician to handle a wide range of user needs efficiently.
